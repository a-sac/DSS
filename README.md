# DSS-ShiftManagement
University project for DSS in Java.

# Don't know what you're looking at? I can explain it to you.
So, in this project we were challenged to create an application that could manage student's shifts. We had to make an interface for students, teachers and also for the course manager(Admin).

# Do you want to try? Of course you want, I know you do!
All you need is:
  - MySQL server installed on your computer;
  - Open MySQLWorkbench or something similar and create the given database above. You see the file criacao-shifts.sql above in the folder "Base de Dados"? That's the one! Open that file and run it!
  - Within the ShiftManagement folder, in the source code, more specifically in the file connect.java change the variables that corresponds to your credentials of MySQL server;
 
 Once these steps done, you just need to run the program.
 
# And... Voilá! 
Enjoy the coolest shift management program!
